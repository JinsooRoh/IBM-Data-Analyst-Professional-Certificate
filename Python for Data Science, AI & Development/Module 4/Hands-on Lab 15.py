# r+ : Reading and writing. Cannot truncate the file.
# w+ : Writing and reading. Truncates the file.

# Exercise

"""
Your local university's Raptors fan club maintains a register of its active members on a .txt document.
Every month they update the file by removing the members who are not active.
You have been tasked with automating this with your Python skills.
Given the file currentMem, Remove each member with a 'no' in their Active column. Keep track of each of the removed members and append them to the exMem file.
Make sure that the format of the original files in preserved. (Hint: Do this by reading/writing whole lines and ensuring the header remains )
Run the code block below prior to starting the exercise. The skeleton code has been provided for you. Edit only the cleanFiles function.

"""

# Exercise: Implement the cleanFiles function in the code cell below.Â¶
'''
The two arguments for this function are the files:
    - currentMem: File containing list of current members
    - exMem: File containing list of old members
    
    This function should remove all rows from currentMem containing 'no' 
    in the 'Active' column and appends them to exMem.
    '''
def cleanFiles(currentMem, exMem):
    # TODO: Open the currentMem file as in r+ mode
        #TODO: Open the exMem file in a+ mode

        #TODO: Read each member in the currentMem (1 member per row) file into a list.
        # Hint: Recall that the first line in the file is the header.

        #TODO: iterate through the members and create a new list of the innactive members

        # Go to the beginning of the currentMem file
        # TODO: Iterate through the members list. 
        # If a member is inactive, add them to exMem, otherwise write them into currentMem
